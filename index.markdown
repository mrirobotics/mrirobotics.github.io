### Workshop at International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR), Atlanta, Georgia, April 19, 2023


## Location

Marcus 1117, Georgia Tech

## Objectives

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a non-invasive system that uses strong magnetic fields to produce detailed visualization of soft tissue. While MRI is powerful in many diagnosis/treatment procedures, it has certain limitations, including the use of medical devices that contain metal and uncomfortable intraprocedural poses for clinicians. A potential solution is the inclusion of compact, MRI-conditional robotics. MRI-conditional robotics refers to the use of robots that have been specifically designed to be safe and compatible with MRI scanners and the MR-imaging workflow. It is a rapidly growing research area that has the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat a wide range of medical conditions. These robots are able to operate in close proximity to the MRI machine and can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including image-guided surgery, biopsy, ablation, chemotherapy, and many others. One of the main advantages of MRI-conditional robotics is that they allow doctors to perform procedures with greater accuracy and precision. MRI-conditional robotics also has the potential to improve patient safety by reducing the need for exposure to radiation, which is often used in x-ray/CT.

Despite these potential benefits, there are several challenges that must be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of MRI-conditional robotics. These include robust robot design that is safe for both patients and medical physician, and software development that presents a streamlined workflow for clinical use. This workshop will be composed of a collection of expert panels that will discuss and present (1) new robotic hardware design (device, actuators, and sensors), (2) new algorithm to enable improved treatment, including control, navigation, and AI, and (3) new application areas that can benefit from MR-guided robotic interventions. This will provide an opportunity to explore the potential of this technology and to identify the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
